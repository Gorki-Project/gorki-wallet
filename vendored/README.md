# Vendored dependecies

We had to apply minor fixes to @tgrospic/rnode-http-js, so we vendored it to get things out the door faster. If there is interest or need, we can easily turn this into a pull request or a fork, but for now, it lives here.

This folder can be used for vendoring other dependencies in cases like this. Generally it is not advisable to do so, because we opt out of any updates/security patches that way, but in some cases it is fine -- @tgrospic/rnode-http-js has not been updated for ~3 years at the time of writing.
